Firstly run path.bat to add it to the Path so you can use the command globally, just run the file and everyting should be alright and you should be able to use the command "game in cmd"
if that command doesn't exist, please restart your pc or wait a few minutes for it to update.

Also don't delete this folder or DO NOT CHANGE THE LOCATION OF THE FILES AND DON'T RENAME THE FOLDERS! Otherwise you need to redo these steps
